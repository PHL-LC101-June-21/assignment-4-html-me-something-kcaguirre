            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>We met in 2017 at the San Antonio Humane Society. The shelter called him Gravy, but I named him after a fictional cat in a series of songs by a band called The Weakerthans. We lived there for a few months before we moved back to New Jersey
                for me to finish school.
